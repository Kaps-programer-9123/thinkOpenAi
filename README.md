# thinkOpenAi

### üîç Overview

This project introduces:

1. A collection of **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating core text and markdown chunking strategies using **LangChain**.
2. A new **Django project** that exposes a REST API for various chunking methods ‚Äî enabling fast prototyping and testing for **GenAI** and **RAG workflows**.

### üìì Notebooks: Key Chunking Methods Implemented

Each notebook showcases a different strategy for breaking down text ‚Äî useful for embedding, retrieval, or generation workflows:

#### **Chunking Techniques Covered:**

1. **Fixed-Size Chunking** ‚Äî slices text into equal-length blocks.
2. **Sliding Window Chunking** ‚Äî creates overlapping chunks for better context preservation.
3. **Paragraph-Based Chunking** ‚Äî respects natural paragraph boundaries.
4. **Token-Based Chunking** ‚Äî splits text based on token count using tokenizers.
5. **Semantic Chunking** ‚Äî uses embeddings/LLMs to chunk semantically.
6. **Recursive Character/Text Splitting** ‚Äî LangChain's flexible chunking utility.
7. **Metadata-Aware Chunking** ‚Äî associates chunks with structured metadata.
8. **Title + Content Chunking** ‚Äî separates section headers from body content.
9. **Hybrid Chunking** ‚Äî combines multiple strategies for advanced use cases.

### üß© Django API: Chunking as a Module

A Django backend was created to serve chunking logic via RESTful endpoints.

#### **Endpoints and Descriptions:**

| Route               | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                 | Home route ‚Äì basic health/info page.                       |
| `/sample`           | Sample route showcasing a default chunking demo.           |
| `/fix_size`         | Performs **Fixed-Size Chunking** on input text.            |
| `/Sliding`          | Applies **Sliding Window Chunking** with overlap logic.    |
| `/token`            | Executes **Token-Based Chunking** using tokenizer length.  |
| `/markdown`         | Entry point for Markdown chunking.                         |
| `/markdown/header`  | Splits markdown by header levels (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`). |
| `/markdown/section` | Chunks markdown based on semantic or structural sections.  |

### ‚úÖ Next Steps

* Integrate support for chunk preview/download in API responses.
* Add unit tests and validation for each chunking method.
* Extend markdown support for nested sections and metadata.

üìò This repository is created for demo and learning purposes, featuring a [`notebooks/`](https://github.com/Kaps-programer-9123/thinkOpenAi/tree/main/gen_ai_notebook) directory with interactive examples and a [`screenshots/`](https://github.com/Kaps-programer-9123/thinkOpenAi/tree/main/screen_shot) section for a visual overview of the work.
