# 🧠 Key Topics for a Generative AI Engineer

A comprehensive roadmap of skills and concepts for working with LLMs, RAG, and modern GenAI systems.

---

## 🎯 1. Foundational Understanding

- Transformer architecture (self-attention, encoder-decoder)
- Tokenization and embeddings
- Generative vs extractive models
- Sampling strategies (temperature, top-k, top-p)

---

## 🧰 2. Prompt Engineering

- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting
- Instruction-based prompts
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Prompt optimization and compression
- Structured output (JSON, SQL)
- Safety and guardrails

---

## 📚 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Document chunking & overlap strategies
- Dense embeddings (e.g. E5, BGE, MiniLM)
- Vector databases: FAISS, Qdrant, Weaviate
- Similarity search (cosine, dot-product)
- Sparse retrieval (BM25, TF-IDF)
- Cross-encoder reranking
- Context injection and templating
- Evaluation: RAGAS, recall@k, grounding

---

## 🧪 4. Fine-Tuning & Adaptation

- Instruction fine-tuning (SFT)
- LoRA / QLoRA (efficient tuning)
- Datasets for tuning (e.g., Alpaca, Dolly)
- `transformers`, `trl`, `peft` libraries
- Evaluation and safety of tuned models

---

## 🧱 5. LLM System Building

- RAG pipeline orchestration
- Tool/function calling (OpenAI, LangChain)
- Agents (AutoGPT, ReAct, CrewAI)
- Fallback chains and retries
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack
- LangGraph (LLM orchestration)

---

## ⚙️ 6. LLMOps & Productionization

- Model serving with vLLM, TGI
- Quantization and batching
- Caching and token streaming
- Prompt and embedding versioning
- Observability: Langfuse, Prometheus, Grafana
- CI/CD for AI workflows

---

## 🧾 7. Evaluation & Testing

- Unit testing for each pipeline step (e.g., Django + pytest)
- Prompt evaluation tools (Promptfoo, OpenAI evals)
- RAG evaluation: recall, answer groundedness, faithfulness
- Human-in-the-loop (RLHF foundations)

---

## 🧩 8. Multimodal AI

- Text + image: GPT-4V, Gemini, BLIP
- Text-to-image: DALL·E, Stable Diffusion
- Speech-to-text: Whisper
- Voice generation: Bark, OpenVoice
- Multimodal pipelines and inputs

---

## 🛡️ 9. Safety, Security & Ethics

- Prompt injection prevention
- Red teaming and adversarial testing
- Hallucination detection
- Usage controls and policy filters
- Data governance and model explainability

---

## 🧠 10. Bonus Topics

- Semantic and hybrid search
- Synthetic data generation
- Graph-based memory (knowledge graphs + LLMs)
- Text classification, summarization, document Q&A
- Auto-evolving LLM pipelines (agentic loops)
