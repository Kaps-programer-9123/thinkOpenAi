# thinkOpenAi

### 🔍 Overview

This project introduces:

1. A collection of **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating core text and markdown chunking strategies using **LangChain**.
2. A new **Django project** that exposes a REST API for various chunking methods — enabling fast prototyping and testing for **GenAI** and **RAG workflows**.

---

### 📓 Notebooks: Key Chunking Methods Implemented

Each notebook showcases a different strategy for breaking down text — useful for embedding, retrieval, or generation workflows:

#### **Chunking Techniques Covered:**

1. **Fixed-Size Chunking** — slices text into equal-length blocks.
2. **Sliding Window Chunking** — creates overlapping chunks for better context preservation.
3. **Paragraph-Based Chunking** — respects natural paragraph boundaries.
4. **Token-Based Chunking** — splits text based on token count using tokenizers.
5. **Semantic Chunking** — uses embeddings/LLMs to chunk semantically.
6. **Recursive Character/Text Splitting** — LangChain's flexible chunking utility.
7. **Metadata-Aware Chunking** — associates chunks with structured metadata.
8. **Title + Content Chunking** — separates section headers from body content.
9. **Hybrid Chunking** — combines multiple strategies for advanced use cases.

### 🧩 Django API: Chunking as a Module

A Django backend was created to serve chunking logic via RESTful endpoints.

#### **Endpoints and Descriptions:**

| Route               | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                 | Home route – basic health/info page.                       |
| `/sample`           | Sample route showcasing a default chunking demo.           |
| `/fix_size`         | Performs **Fixed-Size Chunking** on input text.            |
| `/Sliding`          | Applies **Sliding Window Chunking** with overlap logic.    |
| `/token`            | Executes **Token-Based Chunking** using tokenizer length.  |
| `/markdown`         | Entry point for Markdown chunking.                         |
| `/markdown/header`  | Splits markdown by header levels (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`). |
| `/markdown/section` | Chunks markdown based on semantic or structural sections.  |

### ✅ Next Steps

* Integrate support for chunk preview/download in API responses.
* Add unit tests and validation for each chunking method.
* Extend markdown support for nested sections and metadata.
