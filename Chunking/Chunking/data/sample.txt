One day, an old man was walking along a beach that was littered with thousands of starfish that had been washed ashore by the tide. As he walked, he saw a young boy in the distance, picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean.

As the man approached, he called out, “Good morning! May I ask what you are doing?”

The boy paused, looked up, and replied, “I’m throwing starfish back into the ocean. The tide has washed them up and they can’t return to the sea by themselves. If I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.”

The old man replied, “But there must be tens of thousands of starfish on this beach. I’m afraid you won’t really be able to make much of a difference.”

The boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it as far as he could into the ocean. Then he turned, smiled, and said, “I made a difference to that one.”

The man looked at the boy, thought for a moment, and then began throwing starfish back into the sea, one by one.
